Some easy steps to stay safe on the web!
<!--more-->
The internet is a deep blue ocean. This comparision can be done by the oportunities you can find on the internet - such as new businesses, new tools, even new friends. Also, we can say it because we can't see the end of this ocean, and also because we can find a lot of danger there too.

**Phishing** is a hacking technique that allows attackers to stole your data, almost with your concernment. The name is a joke with _fishing_, where the attackers throw some bait and the users get caught.

When we talk about hacking, people often think about a person with a huge knowledgement about engineering, typing like a weirdo on terminals and trying to access some huge secure system. There are some hackers like that - but, you can be hacked by a kid.

Credit card numbers, passwords, money, sensible data... A phishing attack can stole a large number of things from you. Not only stole, phishing attacks can even attach legal issues to your name - they're easy to create, and they can blow high.


### How can you identify a phishing attack
Basically, a phishing attack will throw a bait into you. A bait can be a broken URL inside an email or a SMS, a phone call trying to "confirm" your data, a fake website with a registration form... There are many types of baits.

If you received an email from a newsletter you never signed for, or a SMS from your banking service with a suspicious link, then you may be under a phishing attack. But, the attack will only be sucessful if you get the bait - if you clik that suspicious link, or if you fill your data in a form.

I'll show you a "real-world example": you receive a message on your cellphone from a encoded number, like `304-120` (just an example!), with some text about your banking account getting cancelled by lack of funds. Also, the message displays a call-to-action for you to click the link to solve the issue.

Your banking service never sends you SMSs, and you notice the link should be `https://myaccount.mybank.com` but, instead, it's `http://mybank.com/account`.

This is a classic phishing example, where the bait throws you an action you might do, without asking yourself _"is it true?"_.

Besides the bait, which is what is thrown into you, you can detect a phishing attack by watching the scenario around - the incorrect link format, the lack of SSL protocols (https), a broken layout at some website (it's green where it'd be grey), imperative call-to-actions like _"do it now"_.


### How to avoid them?
I could simply put "do not click the links", or "do not fill the forms". It's a powerful tip, but it'll depend on the context.
