My personal website and blog source code. :rocket:  
As the name says, it's avaliable at [jlozovei dot dev](https://jlozovei.dev).


## :gem: Stack
This website is built on top of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with some nice plugins, [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) for the styling (since Jekyll offers native support) and some JavaScript bundled with [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).

I'm using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) as my CI/CD and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) as the host (with a custom domain).

### :earth_americas: :earth_africa: :earth_asia: Translations
The website is available in english ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ and brazilian portuguese ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·! :tada:

I've used [jekyll-paginate-multiple](https://github.com/scandio/jekyll-paginate-multiple) plugin, and followed two nice tutorials to accomplish it:

- [Paginate a Dual Language Blog in Jekyll - Webniyom](https://webniyom.com/jekyll-dual-language/)
- [Making Jekyll multilingual - Sylvain Durand](https://www.sylvaindurand.org/making-jekyll-multilingual/)
