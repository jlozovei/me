Hi there! Nice to see you here.  
This repo is dedicated to my personal website, my resume and some cool info about me :smile:

## :squirrel: About me
Front-end developer, writer, speaker and amateur musician in the spare time.  
I started in the development world when was about 15/16yo - my first contact with programming was in a course called _Web Designer Development_, given by Microcamp in Curitiba.  
By the time, I was in high school. After finishing it, I picked up a place at College through ProUni (a brazilian government program that offers student scholarships); and since then I'm into this crazy world called _development_.


## :mortar_board: Graduation
- Graduation: FARESC - I.T. Management (2016)
- Post-graduation: Universidade Positivo - Embedded Systems and IoT (2019)

I went to college through ProUni; in 2014 started the _I.T. Management_ course at FARESC, in Curitiba. The course lasted 2.5 years and I had subjects from the development/programming world - programming logic and algorithms, databases, web development - and from the management world - people management, strategic planning...

During the 3rd period of colleg I got an internship - although tried before, couldn't get in because of my lack of experience and since just got into college, hadn't seen some subjects that were important to get started on an internship program.

After graduating in Jun/2016, took the rest of the year to focus on my work - I had already completed my internship - and study on my field (front-end development).

At the beginning of 2017 I decided to get back to study in a "serious" way - joined the _Embedded Systems and IoT_ postgraduation at Positivo. It was a big change for me as I started to get into another kind of development - the famous low level. In this course I had contact with analog electronic, microcontrollers development (Arduino, Tiva C, Raspberry...), mobile development (Android, with Java); in addiction to seeing subjects about smart cities, big data...


## :office: Professional experiences

#### Livetouch (2015 - 2017)


#### EBANX (2018 - 2019)


#### Bcredi (2019 - now)


## :rocket: Projects
In addiction to code professionally, I also have some personal projects that serves both as study and a way of doing what I can't do at work. It's also a way to make a significant contribution to the open source community.

The most recent works are:

#### Developer Titles - [site](https://developertitles.com/) | [github](https://github.com/jlozovei/developer-titles)
This is a project that shows developer's titles in a funny way, derived from some of the finest things I saw on GitHub and LinkedIn.

#### Flavored Markdown - [site](https://jlozovei.github.io/flavored-markdown/) | [github](https://github.com/jlozovei/flavored-markdown)
Markdown live editor, where you input the markdown and the page parses to HTML, showing it with GitHub style. It helps to create `README` or `CONTRIBUTING` files.

#### Has front-end ended yet? - [site](https://hasfrontendendedyet.com/) | [github](https://github.com/jlozovei/hasfrontendendedyet.com)
This is a more protest-driven project, as every year someone comes up on the internet saying that _"the front-end is going to end"_ - and we all know it won't.


## :necktie: Articles and Lectures

#### Writing
Some time ago I started to write about technology, careers and topics related to the development routine. You can read my texts in the publications/communities below:

- [Training Center ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·](https://medium.com/trainingcenter/) 
- [Codeburst.io ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸](https://codeburst.io/) 
- [dev.to ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸](https://dev.to/jlozovei) 

And, in a near future, you'll also find nice posts on my blog (spoiler :boom:)!


#### Lectures
Recenlty I entered this world of lecturing about techonology. In 2019 spoke at CapiConf, a regional event of the Curitiba dev community; and had the opportunity to talk at BrazilJS OnTheRoad Curitiba - a "pocket edition" event, organized by BrazilJS staff focused on local communities.
At both events I talked about _Web Accessibility_, and you can find the slides and references in the repo [jlozovei/the-age-of-accessibility](https://github.com/jlozovei/the-age-of-accessibility).

:warning: Soon the english versions of the slides will be available
