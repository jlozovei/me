# jlozovei dot dev
My personal website and blog source code. :rocket:  
As the name says, it's avaliable at [jlozovei dot dev](https://jlozovei.dev).


## :gem: Stack
This website is built on top of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with nice plugins - and [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/), since Jekyll natively supports it.

For now, not using any JS - soon it'll be changed! :boom:

I'm using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) as my CI/CD and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) as the host (with a custom domain).
