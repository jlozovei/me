# jlozovei dot dev
My personal website and blog source code. :rocket:  
As the name says, it's avaliable at [jlozovei dot dev](https://jlozovei.dev).

[![Deploy](https://github.com/jlozovei/me/actions/workflows/deploy.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/jlozovei/me/actions/workflows/deploy.yml)


## :gem: Stack
This website is built on top of [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) with some nice plugins, [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) for the styling and [jest](https://jestjs.io/) with [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/) for testing.

I'm using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) as my CI/CD and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) as the host (with a custom domain).


## :computer: Developing
In case you want to use my website as a template for yours, first you may fork the project.  
Then, use the following scripts:

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# start the project at localhost:8000
npm start

# run the tests
npm run test
```

You also may change the content, pages (routing) and a lot of stuff; feel free to do it. :rocket:
