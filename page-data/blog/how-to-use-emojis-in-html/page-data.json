They‚Äôre on chat apps, graphic design banners, websites, everywhere‚Ä¶</p>\n<p>Some people dislike its use on marketing and content; I personally like, sometimes more than icons. And, in order to use them on the web we need to follow some rules; to make it accessible for every one!</p>\n<h3>First of all, what is an emoji?</h3>\n<p>Following the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji\">wikipedia definition of an emoji</a>, it is an <em>ideogram</em> used in electronic messages and web pages. They‚Äôre inspired by <em>pictograms</em> and their predecessor were the <em>emoticons</em>.</p>\n<p>So, basically, an emoji is an image that represents a person, an object, a letter or a number. And, those images are nothing but <em>unicodes</em> converted to visual representations.</p>\n<h3>What could go wrong using it?</h3>\n<p>As any text or image, the interpretation of an emoji is subjective - every person will have their own. So, beware when using an emoji, because it could mean a totally different thing from what you want.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you use an eggplant emoji, this could mean another thing from what you want!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I don‚Äôt consider it as a problem, but every platform has its own visual implementation of emojis. Facebook, Twitter, Apple, Google‚Ä¶ Everybody has own emoji styles, and it could affect the emoji‚Äôs use context.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I like to put emojis no my projects‚Äô <code class=\"language-text\">README.md</code> files - when I see the file on a MacOS device, the emojis‚Äô style are completely different compared to a Windows device.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Since they‚Äôre unicode characters converted to images, it could also lead do misunderstandings for disabled people - visual, cognitive. That‚Äôs why we need to choose a clear communication line, use them (emojis) in a safe way.</p>\n<h3>Using emojis on HTML</h3>\n<p>You may heard or know a lot of different techniques to use emojis on your page, independent of the platform you‚Äôre using - WordPress, Jekyll, plain HTML, any JS framework (React, Vue, Angular, Svelte‚Ä¶). But, there‚Äôs a simple way to use them, and I‚Äôm gonna show you:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"html\"><pre class=\"language-html\"><code class=\"language-html\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>span</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">aria-label</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>Ice cream emoji<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">role</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>img<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>üç¶<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>span</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span></code></pre></div>\n<p>In the example above, we‚Äôre using <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA\">WAI ARIA attributes</a> to give the emoji a semantic meaning - and it‚Äôs very useful for screen readers, for example; because we‚Äôre ensuring the meaning of the emoji used.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code class=\"language-text\">aria-label</code> attribute will define a label to the element;</li>\n<li>The <code class=\"language-text\">role</code> attribute will define how the element will behave: in this case, it‚Äôll behave as an image.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>About WAI ARIA</h3>\n<p>The <em>WAI ARIA</em> attributes can be used with any front-end framework, and will be interpreted by every browser. It can be used in addition to the new HTML5 semantic tags (article, header, footer, aside‚Ä¶), to provide more contextual information about your page‚Äôs elements. They can be divided by three categories:</p>\n<h4>1 - Roles</h4>\n<p><em>Roles</em> will define how the element will behave inside the document - an image, a list, an article‚Ä¶</p>\n<h4>2 - Properties</h4>\n<p><em>Properties</em> will add semantic context to the element. They‚Äôre used to pass information about the element for the browser and users.</p>\n<h4>3 - States</h4>\n<p><em>States</em> will tell the browser what‚Äôs going on with the element at an specific period of time - if the element is enable/disabled, hidden, open/closed‚Ä¶</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The WAI ARIA <em>working draft</em> is from 2008, and in 2014 it became a complete <em>W3C Recommendation</em> - so, it‚Äôs been there for a while. It can be hardly used with <em>accordions</em>, <em>dropdowns</em> and many other components with visual interactions.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A curiosity: since version <a href=\"https://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2\"><em>2.3.2</em></a>, Bootstrap implements the WAI ARIA attributes on its markup.</p>\n</blockquote>","timeToRead":3,"frontmatter":{"date":"04/07/2020","title":"How to use emojis in HTML?","category":"tutorial","excerpt":"Emojis are cool, use them - in the right way!"},"fields":{"langKey":"en","slug":"/blog/how-to-use-emojis-in-html/"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"b81dcfc2-9c09-571d-be9e-a0be00452b5f"}},
