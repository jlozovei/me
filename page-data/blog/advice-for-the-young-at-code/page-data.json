As a developer, a designer, a manager, a teacher. The difference between a beginner and an expert is <strong>experience</strong>, and it only comes with time.</p>\n<p>It’s very common for developers try to keep up with every technology trend we heard of. A new framework, a new technique or even a new language. Overnight we already want to master this new stuff, we want to teach and spread the word. And, when we can’t do it - almost all the times - we get frustrated and seems it’s the end, we’re no more capable of doing great stuff.</p>\n<p>I remember my early days with web development, when I can’t understang what a <em>grid layout</em> was, and how the <em>columns</em> scheme worked. Damn I felt sad, like I was the dumbest developer of all time. Now I remember that time and I think “I was really dumb”, but not to don’t know how it worked, but to feel that way.</p>\n<p>Some weeks later I was already understanding and using <em>grid layouts</em> on my webpages, and I was trying to improve the grid system I was using… It was only a matter of experience (and time).</p>\n<p>The big mistake we do is that leap bigger than our legs, and then we fall and feel disgraceful because we couldn’t understand how a thing works, or how to use it the right way. The advice behind this <em>coach-like</em> article is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Take your time! Don’t rush things.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To learn, to create, to share and to teach. Avoid comparing yourself to other people, because every person has its own time. When we learn it, everything gets simpler. I keep learning it everyday. As I’m a musician, I’ve learned that mastering an instrument demands hard study and time; software development works in the same way.</p>\n<p>Quite often I see new developers discovering Bootstrap, or people I follow on GitHub starring repos that I’ve already starred in the last year, and I think <em>“well, it’s nice they’re discovering it too”</em>. Some people may think they’re late, and they should be exploring other stuff. But, they have their own time, as well as I do have mine and you have yours.</p>\n<p>Experience comes with quality time - learning, trying, failing and trying again. Resilience is a soft skill that you must develop in order to achieve great things. When we fail - and we fail a lot - it’s a unique opportunity to push it back and try to do things better; it’s not the time to give up and try other thing. If you give up at one thing, you’ll probably will give up at the second.</p>\n<p>By <em>quality time</em> I mean studying, practicing, improving. And doing it the right way - respecting the limits of your body and mind. You’ll miss those nights you didn’t sleep in order to study more. When your body calls, listen to it.</p>\n<p>No one can learn or practice when tired, mentally and physically exhausted. A fit mind would only work in a fit body. Eat right, sleep well, do some excercises to keep your body moving, try to create a healthiest routine. And, between it, study and practice your skills.</p>\n<p>If it’s HTML, try to create a page, or redo a page you like; if it’s Ruby, try to create an algorythm; if it’s English, try to write a blog post. But try to do it at your time - don’t rush; I guess you all got it!</p>\n<p>And, if possible, try to track your progress: write what you’ve done, your high and lowlights during your study/practice time. You can do it on paper, or even on <a href=\"https://evernote.com/\">Evernote</a>, <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/\">Notion</a> or on your GitHub account.</p>\n<p>Write down sentences, explaining your feelings about what you’re writing - if it’s a failure, write the <em>“why”s</em> and the <em>“because”s</em> you’ve failed; if it’s a success, write the accomplishments you’ve reached, and how you feel about it. Avoid only <em>checklist-style</em> notes, because you’ll forget what you were feeling at the time when you write.</p>\n<p>By doing it, you’ll became a better person and a better developer. You’ll have your own resources against failures and errors that might cross your path, and you’ll became more practical when a situation gets in front of you.</p>","timeToRead":3,"frontmatter":{"date":"04/13/2020","title":"Advice for the young at code","category":"thoughts","excerpt":"Soon we will be older..."},"fields":{"langKey":"en","slug":"/blog/advice-for-the-young-at-code/"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"4e894276-0875-52c1-964d-a444980ddd7c"}},
