But, is all of this content relevant? Probably the results on the first page are; and I bet you’ll find what you’re searching is within the first 3 or 4 results (in the real world, you won’t search after the second).</p>\n<p>If you search for <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/javascript\">“Javascript error on StackOverflow”</a>, the same will happen - a lot of stuff will be in the results. But, how many results will be relevant for you? How many results you will need to solve your bug?</p>\n<p>Trying to answer those questions, I (think I have) answered the question on the title of this post - <em>“is it worthy to have a blog in 2020?”</em> - The answer is <strong>yes</strong>.</p>\n<h3>But, why at all?</h3>\n<p>I’ve started to write about technology and carrer in the beggining of 2018, when I saw my friend <a href=\"https://vnbrs.com\">Vinicius Brasil</a> writing on Medium. That time I thought <em>“well I could do that too!”</em>. He encouraged me a lot to write on Medium too, and it was a huge opportunity to improve my english skills - at the time, I was a bit rusty.</p>\n<p>While writing, I noticed that we could find content for almost everything, but only in english - there was and there is still a lack of good content about technology in portuguese. Due to it, I started to write for <a href=\"https://medium.com/trainingcenter\">Training Center</a>, a brazilian software development Medium publication, focused on teaching newcomers.</p>\n<p>Somewhere in 2018 I also discovered <a href=\"https://dev.to\">The Practical Dev</a> - or <em>dev dot to</em>, as many people call it. <em>dev.to</em> is a huge software development community, and their applications are open source - it says a lot about them. At that time, I was writing on my personal Medium, for Training Center and also <a href=\"https://codeburst.io/\">Codeburst</a> (a great Medium publication focused on web development).</p>\n<p>The engagement on <em>dev.to</em> was higher than on Medium. So I decided to keep my brazilian portuguese posts on my personal Medium profile and the english texts on <em>dev.to</em>. But, we all know Medium - it hasn’t syntax highlight, the paywall sucks, the editor is a bit limited… There are a lot of issues related to it, and if you search on Google <em>“why Medium sucks”</em>, you’ll find a lot more reasons.</p>\n<p>In front of this, I decided to redo my website (which was a static generated from a React app) and turn it into a blog. And today it’s super easy and fast to create a personal blog. You have <a href=\"https://jekyllrb.com/\">Jekyll</a>, <a href=\"https://gohugo.io/\">Hugo</a>, <a href=\"https://gridsome.org/\">Gridsome</a> (for Vue) and <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/\">Gatsby</a> (for React) as platforms; also, you have <a href=\"https://www.netlifycms.org/\">Netlify CMS</a>, <a href=\"https://forestry.io/\">Forestry</a>, <a href=\"https://strapi.io/\">Strapi</a>, <a href=\"https://cloudcannon.com/\">CloudCannon</a> and a lot more headless CMS. If you’re <em>old school</em>, you can always count on <a href=\"https://wordpress.com\">WordPress</a> as well.</p>\n<p>I like to say that having a personal blog and writing on communities is almost the same thing as having a full-time job and do some freelances. For me, having a personal blog is a nice experience because you’ll have a life-time project, where you can experiment and try new things (which you probably can’t do on your full-time job), you can write about (almost) anything since it’s your blog and also you create a new source of knowledge.</p>\n<p>As I was saying in the begining of this post, you can find a great amount of content on the internet, but the amount of <em>good content</em> won’t be the same. That’s the main reason I believe having a blog is worthy!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Take a look on this list of <a href=\"https://github.com/kilimchoi/engineering-blogs\">awesome software engineering blogs</a></p>\n</blockquote>","timeToRead":3,"frontmatter":{"date":"04/06/2020","title":"Is it worthy to have a blog in 2020?","category":"thoughts","excerpt":"Is even worthy to have a blog at all?"},"fields":{"langKey":"en","slug":"/blog/is-it-worthy-to-have-a-blog/"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"34809b8c-b84b-545f-996a-67bd259afa4c"}},
