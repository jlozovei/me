So, here is my personal setup for developing and designing this year.</p>\n<h3>Hardware</h3>\n<p>At home, I’m using my personal 2017 MacBook Pro, 13-inch, 2,3 GHz Dual-Core Intel Core i5 with 8GB of RAM. No extra screens, no extra mouses nor keyboards.</p>\n<p>At work, I’m using a Dell Latitude 3400, 13-inch, Intel Core i5 with 16GB of RAM (with Windows). Also, no extra screens, no extra mouses nor keyboards.</p>\n<h3>Text Editor</h3>\n<p>I’ve been using <a href=\"https://www.sublimetext.com/\">Sublime Text 3</a> as my text editor for a while. It’s clean, pretty and fast. And it also has lots of nice extensions. I’m currently using:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Alignment</li>\n<li>Babel</li>\n<li>Carbon</li>\n<li>Color Highlight</li>\n<li>Elixir</li>\n<li>Emmet</li>\n<li>JavaScript Patterns</li>\n<li>JavaScriptNext - ES6 Syntax</li>\n<li>JSONLint</li>\n<li>JsPrettier</li>\n<li>Nunjucks Syntax</li>\n<li>Package Control</li>\n<li>PyV8</li>\n<li>Ruby Slim</li>\n<li>Sass</li>\n<li>Seti_UI</li>\n<li>Seti_UX</li>\n<li>Simple JSX</li>\n<li>Trimmer</li>\n<li>TypeScript</li>\n<li>TypeScript Syntax</li>\n<li>Vue Syntax Highlight</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There’s a lot of plugins here, and I know I need to remove some of them. I’ll keep it in my backlog.</p>\n<p>I’m considering to try a new text editor. In the last years I’ve used <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/\">WebStorm</a> for a while and also <a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/\">VSCode</a>. For some reason I don’t know yet, I’m not so into VSCode, and I’m willing to try <a href=\"https://atom.io/\">Atom</a> this year.</p>\n<h3>Terminal</h3>\n<p>At home I use <a href=\"https://www.iterm2.com/\">iTerm2</a> as my default terminal, with <a href=\"https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh\">Oh My Zsh</a> and <code class=\"language-text\">robbyrussell</code> theme.</p>\n<p>At work, I’m using Git Bash as my terminal - since it supports UNIX-like commands.</p>\n<h3>Browser</h3>\n<p>I use Google Chrome for development since forever; my last one was Firefox with Firebug extension (old, I know). My current version is 80. To test stuff I also use Firefox (72) and Safari (13).</p>\n<p>On mobile, I use Safari since it’s the default browser, but also tried to use <a href=\"https://www.cakebrowser.com/\">Cake Browser</a>.</p>\n<h3>Design</h3>\n<p>This year I’ve been using Adobe XD a lot, more than Sketch; I’m getting the way with XD.</p>\n<h3>Stack</h3>\n<p>I’ve started the year using React at my full-time job at Bcredi. This month (april) I moved on to a new challenge at Paraná Banco, and there they also use React with Next; this year is my <em>“React year”</em> so far.</p>\n<p>On my personal jobs I’m betting on vanilla stuff, to avoid keeping only with React or Vue as the last years.</p>\n<p>I’m doing a lot of freelances using WordPress too, since it’s easy and fast to build; and it’s easy to non-tech people to use and update stuff.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>On my <a href=\"/uses\">uses page</a>, there is a complete list of what I’m using to develop, design, create and share. You might take a look!</p>","timeToRead":2,"frontmatter":{"date":"04/10/2020","title":"My developer setup for 2020","category":"personal","excerpt":"My personal developer setup for 2020."},"fields":{"langKey":"en","slug":"/blog/my-developer-setup-for-2020/"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"b8ed9f3f-2cad-5ffd-a786-ab2abada8808"}},
