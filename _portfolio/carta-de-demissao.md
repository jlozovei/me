Carta de Demissão is a website which helps you to create a nice-looking resignation letter for professional uses.

While working at EBANX, I struggled to find a reliable template or guide to follow while creating my resignation letter. So the idea of develop a website to help people during this process came through.

I decided to create the website using React to take advantage on _Context API_, storing the users' data to render the letter model. To style it I used _styled-components_ and Google Fonts; also, created the automated tests using jest and _testing-library_.

This project is open source, based on [GitHub](https://github.com/jlozovei/cartadedemissao.com). It uses GitHub Actions as the CI and GitHub Pages as the hosting; the custom domain is provided by Google Domains.
