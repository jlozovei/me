Tropico TV's insitutional website.
<!--more-->
Trópico is an audiovisual agency from Curitiba, Brazil. Their main focus is _real histories_, and their content are drived for social businesses and causes.

Alongside my friend [Daniel Koganas](https://koganas.com/), we helped Trópico to modernize their website, helping them to display their work in a fancy way.

Daniel worked on the new UX/UI, and together we developed the new website using WordPress, JavaScript ES5 and PostCSS. We also used GitHub as our git platform.

This project required a lot of attention on SEO, accessibility and performance - the site must be fast while beautiful, and interaction-rich.

We developed a _one page_ styled website, with internal pages from each section. This way, the navigation is guaranteed without any break for the user; and the user can also view their blog posts without leaving the home page.
