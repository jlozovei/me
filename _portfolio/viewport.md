A nice online tool to discover some useful information about your current viewport, browser and OS.
<!--more-->
While working with growth hacking and new users' acquisition focused on end-user products, I've had a lot of issues with in-app browsers (i.e. Instagram, LinkedIn...) and webviews. This tool aims to provide some useful information about your current viewport, browser and OS.

I've written the tool using Svelte, some nice handmade styling + Google Fonts and the unit testing suite with jest.

This project is open source, based on [GitHub](https://github.com/jlozovei/cartadedemissao.com). It uses GitHub Actions as the CI and GitHub Pages as the hosting; the custom domain is provided by Google Domains.
