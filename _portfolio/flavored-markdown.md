In-browser markdown editor with flavors.
<!--more-->
A nice in-browser markdown editor, Flavored Markdown displays how your `.md` files would look on different platforms: such as GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Azure and many more.

Created using Vue and vuex, the idea of this website came while comparing the markdown preview styles from GitHub and Bitbucket. As a _readme writer_, I like to know how my files would look on different platforms, so this was a tool to help me through this.

This project is open source, based on [GitHub](https://github.com/jlozovei/flavored-markdown). It uses GitHub Actions as the CI and GitHub Pages as the hosting; the custom domain is provided by Google Domains.
