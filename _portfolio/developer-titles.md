After seeing some hyperbolic titles on LinkedIn, I was inspired by [Pseudo Design Titles](https://designtitles.com/) to create those _pseudo titles_ for technology and development.

The website idea is to joke on how tech people call themselves on their job and roles.

This project is open source, based on [GitHub](https://github.com/jlozovei/developer-titles). It uses GitHub Actions as the CI and GitHub Pages as the hosting; the custom domain is provided by Google Domains.
