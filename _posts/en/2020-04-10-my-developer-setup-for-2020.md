My personal developer setup for 2020.
<!--more-->
We're already on april (damn, where the last 3 months went?), and it may be late to show my personal setup for this year. So, here is my personal setup for developing and designing this year.

### Hardware
At home, I'm using my personal 2017 MacBook Pro, 13-inch, 2,3 GHz Dual-Core Intel Core i5 with 8GB of RAM. No extra screens, no extra mouses nor keyboards.

At work, I'm using a Dell Latitude 3400, 13-inch, Intel Core i5 with 16GB of RAM (with Windows). Also, no extra screens, no extra mouses nor keyboards.


### Text Editor
I've been using [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/) as my text editor for a while. It's clean, pretty and fast. And it also has lots of nice extensions. I'm currently using:

- Alignment
- Babel
- Carbon
- Color Highlight
- Elixir
- Emmet
- JavaScript Patterns
- JavaScriptNext - ES6 Syntax
- JSONLint
- JsPrettier
- Nunjucks Syntax
- Package Control
- PyV8
- Ruby Slim
- Sass
- Seti_UI
- Seti_UX
- Simple JSX
- Trimmer
- TypeScript
- TypeScript Syntax
- Vue Syntax Highlight

There's a lot of plugins here, and I know I need to remove some of them. I'll keep it in my backlog.

I'm considering to try a new text editor. In the last years I've used [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) for a while and also [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/). For some reason I don't know yet, I'm not so into VSCode, and I'm willing to try [Atom](https://atom.io/) this year.


### Terminal
At home I use [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) as my default terminal, with [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) and `robbyrussell` theme.

At work, I'm using Git Bash as my terminal - since it supports UNIX-like commands.


### Browser
I use Google Chrome for development since forever; my last one was Firefox with Firebug extension (old, I know). My current version is 80. To test stuff I also use Firefox (72) and Safari (13).

On mobile, I use Safari since it's the default browser, but also tried to use [Cake Browser](https://www.cakebrowser.com/).


### Design
This year I've been using Adobe XD a lot, more than Sketch; I'm getting the way with XD.


### Stack
I've started the year using React at my full-time job at Bcredi. This month (april) I moved on to a new challenge at Paran√° Banco, and there they also use React with Next; this year is my _"React year"_ so far.

On my personal jobs I'm betting on vanilla stuff, to avoid keeping only with React or Vue as the last years.

I'm doing a lot of freelances using WordPress too, since it's easy and fast to build; and it's easy to non-tech people to use and update stuff.
